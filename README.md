# maas-superstar

1 MAAS, 1-99 Nodes, juju <3, and a monkey.. somewhere..

# What's the end result

A MAAS server controlling nodes (virt w/ option to add bare metal at
your leisure). Juju for deploying resources and everything wrapped up
in a nice bundle to keep you from graying sooner than needed.

# Why?

Hopefully to put some real world perspectives for interested parties
who don't have a team of engineers to sort through every inch of code
and just want to be as competitive as the next.

It's also fun to work with these technologies but if you spend hours
and hours setting it up then it can be demotivating to continue. At
least with this its a few simple commands and it'll setup a
reproducible environment to engineer and deploy.

# Works on

Precise, Quantal, Raring, Saucy, and any future releases.

# Running

```
% git clone git@github.com:battlemidget/maas-superstar.git
